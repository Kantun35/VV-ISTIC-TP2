# TCC *vs* LCC

Explain under which circumstances *Tight Class Cohesion* (TCC) and *Loose Class Cohesion* (LCC) metrics produce the same value for a given Java class. Build an example of such as class and include the code below or find one example in an open-source project from Github and include the link to the class below. Could LCC be lower than TCC for any given class? Explain.

A refresher on TCC and LCC is available in the [course notes](https://oscarlvp.github.io/vandv-classes/#cohesion-graph).

## Answer

TCC and LCC are metrics used to evaluate the Cohesion of a class, It is used to see how much the class respect the SOLID principle

TCC : will get all possible pairs of methods and will then verify if the two methods use atleast one instance variable of the class
then you will increment a counter by one. when you tested all the methods. you divide the number of Pairs by this counter.

LCC : LCC work almost the same except that the link doesn't need to be direct it can be indirect. At the end you divide the number of pairs by the counter.

class VVex1

  int A
  int B
  int C
  int D
  int E

  method 1 :
    some code using A
    some code using C

  method 2 :
    some code using B
    some code using D

  method 3 :
    some code using C
    some code using E
    
  method 4 :
    some code using B
    some code using D
    some code using E

  (mx = method x)
  (nb = methods count)
  Calcul TCC 
    m1 & m2 : nothing  :  +0
    m1 & m3 : C        :  +1
    m1 & m4 : nothing  :  +0
    m2 & m3 : nothing  :  +0
    m2 & m4 : B,D      :  +1
    m3 & m4 : E        :  +1
    counter = 3 
    TCC = counter/nb = 3/4 = 0.75
    
  Calcul LCC
    m1 & m2 : nothing  : m1->m3->m4->m2  : +1
    m1 & m3 : C        : m1->m3          : +1
    m1 & m4 : nothing  : m1->m3->m4      : +1
    m2 & m3 : nothing  : m2->m4->m3      : +1
    m2 & m4 : B,D      : m2->m4          : +1
    m3 & m4 : E        : m3->m4          : +1
    counter =  6
    LCC = counter/nb = 6/4 = 1.5
